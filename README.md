[the code to publish data by wifi using zmq, msg_sync.py](./selfdrive/golden/msg_sync.py)

[the code to receive data by wifi using zmq (json format) phone_control.py ](./selfdrive/golden/phone_control.py)

### automaticlly adjust in lane offset
It will check if the ego car is in the left most lane or right most lane or middle lane,

if ego is in left most lane, it will adjust the offset 0.2m to the left and vice versa to keep distance away from the big truck.

Sometimes the car is driving too much "dead center", human driver wont do that

keep left (0.2m) if you have cars on your right side

keep center is there is no car surrounded

### offline simulation testing tool
Instead of carla, we use a simple python script to simulate in car environment with mock can messages

``` sh
ssh to C2
cd /data/openpilot
./selfdrive/golden/can_bridge.py # start simulation
```
to selfdrive/golden/ folder with you own repo without modifying any source code of openpilot
